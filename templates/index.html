    <h3>Login</h3>
    <p>
        The login system works if you type in an existing user's username
        and password. To find that, click on the tour tab to see the list
        of users. Within login, you can also create a new user. The reset
        password feature will be implemented at a later time.
    </p>
    <h3>Tour</h3>
    <p>
        Displays a list of users. The password will not be shown in the
        final version, but it's there to show that how the login system works.
    </p>
    <h3>Database</h3>
    <p>
        The product systems allows the user to create, delete, and update
        items in the database. The list of items are also displayed within
        the same page.
